## Overview

The dashboard is a critical feature for mini-app success. Within the Apps in Toss console, it enables developers to monitor "DAU, demographic data, age groups, and retention metrics at a glance," facilitating informed decisions about service improvements and traffic strategies.

## Access and Requirements

Users can access the dashboard through the '분석하기' (Analytics) tab on the console home menu after launching their mini-app.

**Key Prerequisites:**
- SDK version 0.0.26 or higher
- Live launch required (sandbox and pre-launch data unavailable)
- Data visibility begins one day after service launch

**Future Enhancement:** SDK 0.0.36+ will enable stay-time measurement, providing more detailed user experience analysis.

## Available Metrics

The dashboard displays four weeks of historical data across these dimensions:

**DAU (Daily Active Users)**
- Measures users accessing the app daily
- Described as "the most intuitive indicator of service growth"

**OS-Specific Usage**
- Separates Android and iOS user counts
- Supports OS-specific optimization strategies

**Gender Distribution**
- Identifies male/female user breakdown
- Enables "targeted content planning based on audience composition"

**Age Demographics**
- Covers age groups from teens through 60+
- Supports "customer identification and marketing strategy design"

**Retention Rate**
- Tracks repeat usage within specified periods post-first visit
- Functions as "a core metric measuring service loyalty and satisfaction"

## Strategic Value

The dashboard transcends basic reporting—it serves as a strategic tool. Consistent monitoring and data-driven improvements can yield measurable traffic increases and conversion rate improvements for partner services.
