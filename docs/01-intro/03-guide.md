## Restricted Services and Content

### 1. Digital Assets and Virtual Assets

Services involving ownership, transfer, storage, trading, or issuance (including NFTs) of digital assets are prohibited regardless of legal compliance status, due to risks of asset loss and consumer harm.

### 2. Money Laundering Risk Services

Mini-apps cannot facilitate direct cash or asset exchange, conversion, or refunds due to potential misuse as money laundering channels.

### 3. Illegal or Fraudulent Services

Services enabling identity fraud, hacking, unlawful document distribution, or information collection circumvention are explicitly prohibited.

### 4. Gambling and Lottery Content

Services with gambling elements are banned due to property loss risks, addiction potential, and age restriction concerns.

### 5. Financial Product Intermediation

Services involving loan, insurance, card, or securities offerings are prohibited regardless of licensing status, to prevent consumer protection risks.

### 6. Investment Advisory Services

Services providing stock recommendations or investment strategies that influence individual investor decisions are restricted.

### 7. Social/Dating Platforms

Services facilitating opposite-sex meetings, friend-finding, or chat-based connections are banned due to unverified identity and offline interaction risks.

### 8. Other Policy-Restricted Services

Registration may be denied based on brand trust, UX policies, or risk management considerations.

- **Medical**: Non-face-to-face revenue-generating services prohibited
