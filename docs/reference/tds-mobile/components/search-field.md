# SearchField Component Documentation

## Overview

The `SearchField` component is designed for implementing search input interfaces. It provides built-in fixed positioning and delete functionality with various configuration options.

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```jsx
<SearchField placeholder="Enter search term" />
```

### Fixed Positioning

The component can remain fixed at the top of the screen during scrolling:

```jsx
<SearchField
  placeholder="Search..."
  fixed
  takeSpace
/>
```

**Key properties:**
- `fixed`: Set to `true` to anchor the search field at the screen's top
- `takeSpace`: When `true` with `fixed`, maintains layout spacing to prevent content shift

### Delete Functionality

Handle search term deletion with custom actions:

```jsx
<SearchField
  placeholder="Enter term and click delete button"
  onDeleteClick={() => alert('delete')}
/>
```

The delete button appears automatically and clears input when clicked. The `onDeleteClick` callback triggers custom logic (logging, analytics, etc.).

## Props Interface

### SearchFieldProps

| Property | Default | Type | Description |
|----------|---------|------|-------------|

| `takeSpace` | `true` | `boolean` | Reserves layout space when fixed |
| `onDeleteClick` | â€” | `() => void` | Callback fired on delete icon click |
