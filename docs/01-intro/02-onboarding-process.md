## Overview

Apps in Toss is engineered to enable "quick and straightforward mini app launches for everyone." New developers can follow a structured pathway to establish stable service operations on the Toss platform.

## 5-Step Service Launch Process

### 1. Getting Started

**Register Your App in Console**

The Apps in Toss console serves as the administrative hub for mini app development and management, consolidating contracts, development setup, and launch procedures into one unified interface.

### 2. Design Phase

#### Design Tool Options

Two tools are available:

**App Builder**
- Dedicated UI design tool for partners
- Web-based (no installation required)
- Includes TDS library and core components for rapid completion

**Figma**
- Flexible custom UI development option
- Maintains design consistency

**Essential Guidelines**

Design must adhere to the mini app branding policy, which covers brand exposure, navigation, bridge functionality, and tab bar specifications.

### 3. Development

The development stage emphasizes simplicity and speed. Apps in Toss provides SDK and API resources to minimize complexity.

**Key Components:**
- SDK supports WebView and React Native implementations
- API enables server-to-server communication via mTLS authentication
- Android and iOS environment configuration available
- Pre-launch testing includes sandbox testing and Toss app QR code verification

### 4. Review Process

**Four-Stage Verification:**

1. **Operational Review** — App information, exposure details, and documentation verification
2. **Functional Review** — Error-free operation within Toss app
3. **Design Review** — Compliance with Toss UI guidelines
4. **Security Review** — Personal data and security assessment

**Timeline:** Average 2-3 days

**Gaming Apps:** Must complete rating board certification (Game Rating and Administration Committee, App Store, or Play Store) before launch.

### 5. Launch

Upon approval, confirmation is sent via email. Click the launch button in the console to deploy the mini app. 🚀
