TDS represents a comprehensive design system utilized across Toss products. It encompasses hundreds of components and templates that extend beyond design tooling into development, functioning as a unified language throughout product creation.

### Core Objectives

The system pursues three primary goals:

1. **Quality Assurance** - "제품의 최소 품질을 언제나 보장해요" (Ensures consistent UI standards across all Toss products)

2. **Productivity Enhancement** - Streamlines UI development through reusable, well-designed components, allowing teams to focus on problem-solving rather than design fundamentals.

3. **Excellence in Polish** - Elevates product completeness through consistent interactions, animations, illustrations, and design templates to achieve industry-leading quality standards.
